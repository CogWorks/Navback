Load ACT-R and Navback environment and model by double-clicking load-act-r-6.xfasl. (if load-act-r-6.xfasl doesn't exist, 
open load-act-r-6.lisp and compile and load this file) 

The config-model GUI allows the user to run a single model or a series of models with different :bll and :ans parameters.

To bring up the GUI, type (config-model) in the listener after ACT-R is loaded.

The number of iterations field (default 1) is the number of times to run a single model or the number of times to repeat
the series of models specified by the choices below. 

The Choose conditions field allows the user to choose one or more between subject conditions. The series of models generated 
by the parameter settings will be run for each condition selected.

The Paramter value fields allow the user to run a series of model with different parameter settings for the :bll and :ans parameters,

The initial value is the value of the parameter for the first of the series,
the iteration value is the amount to increase or decrease the parameter by, and
the number of iterations specifies how many time to do this.
All combinations of the two parameters are generated.

Examples
  To run a range of parameters.
   set :bll initial value = .5, iteration value = .01 and number of iterations = 1,
   set :ans initial value = .2, iteration value = .05 and number of iterations = 1 
  A series of six model runs, :bll .5 :ans .2, :bll .5 :ans .25, :bll .6 :ans .2, :bll .6 :ans .25 would be generated.

  To run a single model n times:
    Set number of iterations = n, 
    choose a single between subject condition,
    set :bll number of iterations to 0,
    set :ans number of iterations to 0.

The log file field, if selected causes a log file to be written to the ACT-R user-loads/MNT/DATA folder.
The trace field, if selected causes the trace to be written to the file ACT-R user-loads/MNT/DATA/navback-trace.lisp
