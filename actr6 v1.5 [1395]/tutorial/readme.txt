This directory contains the ACT-R tutorial.  The tutorial 
consists of several units, and there is a separate directory
for each unit which contains all of the files for that unit.

In each unit directory there will be two types of files:
unit texts and model files.  The unit texts will be either
Microsoft Word documents or PDF files (depending on where
you got the ACT-R files), and the model files will be text 
files with a ".lisp" extension.  The primary text for each 
unit will be named "unit#" (where # represents the current 
unit number).  In addition to that there may be one or two 
other texts for a unit.  If there is a file named "unit#_exp"
that document will describe the Lisp code and ACT-R commands 
that implement the experiments used in the models for that 
unit.  If there is a file named "unit#_modeling" then that 
will provide additional information about using the ACT-R 
software and ACT-R Environment tools.
